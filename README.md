StockMarketBar
==============

Stock Market Bar proof of concept. Note that it is barely tested, and is strictly proof of concept.

To use, run the following command in the bin directory in windows cmd prompt: 

java -jar StockMarketBar.jar

To order drinks, press any key when the window is in focus. Then specify the drink ID and the number of orders for that drink. Alternatively, use the new UI frame to enter orders. 

To modify the menu, change the data.txt file. The drink name will be the first item (no spaces), and then the lower bound price, and then the upper bound price.
